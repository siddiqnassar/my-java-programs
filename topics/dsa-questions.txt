Top 5 algorithms :-

1. Breadth first(shortest path from A-> B just like dijksthara) and depth first
2. Dynamic programming (More thoughtful about the solutions we approch) -> Combination Sum
3. Backtracking (all possible solutions by scratch step by step)-> uses recursion 39. Combination Sum, word ladder, permutations , sudoku solver
4. sliding window algorithm like finding longest substring without-repeating-characters
5. Top k elements algorithm
